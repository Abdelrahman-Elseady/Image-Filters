# C++ Image Processing Project

This project is a simple image processing application written in C++ that allows the user to apply various filters to grayscale images in BMP format.

## Features

- **Black and White Conversion**: Converts the image to a binary black-and-white format.
- **Invert Colors**: Inverts the grayscale values of the image.
- **Merge Images**: Merges two images by averaging their pixel values.
- **Flip**: Flips the image either horizontally or vertically.
- **Darken or Lighten**: Darkens or lightens the image by adjusting pixel values.
- **Rotate**: Rotates the image by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
- **Edge Detection**: Detects edges in the image and highlights them.
- **Enlarge**: Enlarge the image by duplicating pixels.
- **Shrink**: Shrinks the image by a factor of 2, 3, or 4.
- **Mirror**: Mirrors a specified half of the image (left/right or upper/lower).
- **Shuffle**: Shuffles the quadrants of the image.
- **Blur**: Applies a blur filter to the image by averaging neighboring pixels.
- **Crop**: Crops the image to a specified rectangular region.
- **Skew**: Skews the image either horizontally or vertically.
